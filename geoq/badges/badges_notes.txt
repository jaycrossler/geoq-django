Pip install django-badges (then cloned due to having to make changes for Django 1.4+)
pip install PIL (un-identified dependency)
Modified models to add metabadge and also add user profile


How does this work:

Django-badges hooks into the save callback for one or more models (in our case, currently the AOI model).  Any time an AOI is saved, we currently check:
  Is this AOI marked completed + with an assigned analyst.
  If so, then that analyst's user profile's score is incremented by BadgeSettings.points
  The analyst is marked as eligible to receive a badge for completing an AOI (will check if analyst already has this badge)
  It then also checks if the analyst has multiple AOIs in multiple projects (NOTE: may want to first check if analyst has the badge since I think checking for the badge is cheaper than how I'm checking for multiple jobs)

Menu.html was modified to include the user's current score and badges; clicking on the badges item in the menu will go to the badge page.

Possible extensions:
1) Currently, django-badges hooks into the post-save function; as far as I know, this means I cannot determine (from inside this function) what changed in the model, so I don't currently handle if an analyst was awarded points but would have just lost them because an admin "fixed" an AOI to be owned by a different analyst (but I do sort of handle it in the sense that when the analyst does get points, it currently recalculates the score from scratch, because I also can't tell if an AOI was being marked as completed (which should score points) or if a completed AOI was being updated for other reasons (which shouldn't).  I considered modifying django-badges to hook into pre-save function which lets me see the fields to be changed, which gives me some ability to potentially identify stuff

2) Adding additional badges

3) Points for supervisors

4) Django-badges has the ability to map images to different badges but they aren't being shown at the moment (this looks like I just need to find / write the css for metal and/or medal classes)
